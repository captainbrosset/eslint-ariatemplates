eslint-ariatemplates
====================

A set of eslint rules to help validate ariatemplates projects.

Installation
============

* Install NodeJS
* Install eslint `npm install -g eslint`
* Clone this repo
* `cd` in the repo
* Run `eslint -c eslint.json --rulesdir rules path/to/my/file.js`

You should also run the default eslint rules if you want proper linting of your JS code. These rules only check a few ariatemplates related things.
